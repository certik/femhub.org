                <h1 class="heading">What is hp-FEM?</h1>
                <font color=purple><b>hp-FEM</b></font> is a modern version of the Finite Element Method (FEM). It combines
                adaptively finite elements of variable size (h) and polynomial degree (p) to attain extremely fast,
                <em>exponential</em> convergence. This makes is vastly superior to standard low-order FEM methods
                which nowadays are abundant in both the academic and commercial software packages. The hp-FEM is more
                demanding than standard FEM from both the mathematical and programming point of view. Therefore,
                hp-FEM codes are rather scarce.  </p>

<font color=purple><b>Example</b></font>:
The following graph corresponding to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hp-FEM">Fichera corner problem</a>
is a representative example of the huge difference in convergence
rates of
adaptive low-order FEM (with linear and quadratic elements) and the
hp-FEM. The horizontal and vertical axes show the number of degrees
of freedom (unknowns in the discrete problem) and the error in
logarithmic scale, respectively.
