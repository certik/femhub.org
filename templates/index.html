		<h1 class="heading">hp-FEM</h1>
		<p>The <strong>hp-FEM</strong> is a modern version of the Finite Element Method (FEM). It combines 
                adaptively finite elements of variable size (h) and polynomial degree (p) to attain extremely fast, 
                <em>exponential</em> convergence. This makes is vastly superior to standard low-order FEM methods 
                which nowadays are abundant in both the academic and commercial software packages. The hp-FEM is more 
                demanding than standard FEM from both the mathematical and programming point of view. Therefore,
                hp-FEM codes are rather scarce.  </p>

		<p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to disseminate the hp-FEM broadly and to create an open-source
                environment that eventually will become an alternative to old commercial FEM codes. </p>
