These are the sources of the http://hpfem.org/ web.

We welcome any suggestions for our pages, feel free to send us a patch.
Follow the instructions below to edit the pages.

How to edit the pages
---------------------

Please edit only the templates in the directory "templates", and then just run
"./generate" from the root directory and it will take the templates and
generate the .html files. The "./generate" script depends on the jinja2 library
(on Debian/Ubuntu, install the "python-jinja2" package).

For example, if you look into templates/hermes.html:

{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block title %}
hp-FEM: Hermes project
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
        <h1 class="heading">Hermes project</h1>
                <p><strong>Hermes</strong> is a free C++/Python
library of adaptive hp-FEM algorithms.
                The following links will lead you to the 1D, 2D and 3D
versions of the library:
                <ul>
                        <li><a href="#">Hermes1D</a> (not available yet)</li>
                        <li><a
href="http://hpfem.math.unr.edu/projects/hermes2d">Hermes2D</a></li>
                        <li><a
href="http://hpfem.math.unr.edu/bugs/projects/show/hermes3d">Hermes3D</a></li>
                </ul>
{% endblock %}


Then you can see, that it takes layout.html (which is the whole html that you
can download from freetemplates.org) a and it only changes the title and the
content.  So the contens is now only edited at one place in
templates/layout.html, then you run "./generate" and it will updated all pages.

When you want to add/delete a new page, then just create/delete a template and
add/delete it's name from ./generate:

#! /usr/bin/env python

from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader
env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('templates'))

templates = ["hermes.html", "contact.html", "femcodes.html", "index.html"]

for template in templates:
    t = env.get_template(template)
    open(template, "w").write(t.render())


Add/delete it from the list "templates".


How to push to femhub.org
-------------------------

The repository has two branches:

master ..... the branch with template sources, just use "./generate" to create
             the html pages, see the README for more info (this branch doesn't
             contain the generated pages)
gh-pages ... the branch which contains just the generated pages

If you push the gh-pages to github, it will automatically create the pages at:

http://certik.github.com/femhub.org

(only instead of "certik" there will be your github name). This is
very nice for testing pages, if you want to ask other people for
opinions on your changes, without doing this "life" on our femhub.org
pages.

If you are satisfied with the changes and you want to push changes to
femhub.org, just do:

git push spilka:/home/git/repos/femhub.org gh-pages

and it will automatically recognize that you have updated the gh-pages
branch and copies the file from the repository (on spilka) to
/home/git/web/femhub.org and the apache rules for femhub.org
point to that directory too.
